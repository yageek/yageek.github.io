2011, I was mainly working on C++/Qt for Gnu/Linux operating systems. I really enjoyed the documentation set and the clear tutorials the development team provided along with the SDK. I guess that still today, you can find a lot of answers by simply reading the documentation or some of the provided code samples.\nWhen I dived into the Apple world, I was glad to see that plenty of good resources was also provided for the main frameworks. You usually takes the same path when you are using a library for the first time: reading the programmming guide, reading the the main classes documentation and may be watching\nsome WWDC introducton videos. Most of the times, this is enough to remove the magic and understand how the mechanics work.\nI would say that this is not true for CoreData. It is the only framework I heard people avoid to use because they see it as too complex and badly documented.\nBadly documented may be too harsh. I would say that the information about CoreData is widespread in a lot of differents places. I would even say, that some information are \"hidden\" only inside some WWDC videos, especially regarding the concurrency and the potential stack configurations 1.\nHopefully, different books have been published (I would recommend 2 and 3) that help to find the missing pieces of this big puzzle.\nI would like to start a series of post presenting CoreData using a different approach, starting more from the code documentation and trying to provide some explanations about how the framework seems to work under the hood.\nAll the code related to the series will be pusblished on this github repository: https://github.com/yageek/a-taste-of-core-data.\nWhat is CoreData?\nDescribing CoreData is not so easy. A lot of developers I met simply describes Core Data as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) library around SQLite. You could agree with this, but it does not describes CoreData completely/correctly.\nAccording to me, the best description has been provided by Matt Thompson inside his post on NSHipster.com:\nContrary to popular belief, Core Data is not an Object-Relational Mapper, but rather an object graph and persistence framework, capable of much more than the Active Record pattern alone is capable of. Using Core Data as an ORM necessarily limits the capabilities of Core Data and muddies its conceptual purity. But for many developers longing for the familiarity of an ORM, this trade-off is a deal at twice the price! - Matt Thomson\n{: .notice }\nThe key elements here are object graph and persistence.\nYou use CoreData to create graphes of objects and you would eventually persist thoses graphes on the disk.\nIt differs from the notion of an ORM in the sense that you manipulate a graph of connected nodes instead of manipulating a set of records stored in a set of tables.\nORM/SQLITE: involves mostly writing SQL statements that returns Record (Pure Value elements) from a sets of tables.\nGraph: involves looking for object instances (node) from a specific graph instance.\nWhy using CoreData?\nThe next question is why would you use CoreData? There are plenty of reason to use CoreData:\nTo create the Model part of your MVVM/MVC architecture.\nTo persist this model in the disk if needed.\nSimplify the feeding of UI elements.\nAdvanced usages can be used to help synchronization with backend services.\nCoreData as a graph framework\nOne graph is composed of nodes and edges.\nCoreData has three classes representing those notions:\nGraph: NSManagedObjectContext\nNode: NSManagedObject\nEdge: NSRelationshipDescription\nHow do we create a graph?\nGraph\nCreating a graph is equivalent to create an instance of the NSManagedObjectContext class. This class has only one designated initializer\ninitWithConcurrencyType:.\nDon't pay attention to the provided constant for now, we'll detail it in a future post. Just remind that after\nthis call, a new instance of one graph is created.\nNode\nCreating a node is equivalent to create one instance of the NSManagedObject class. If we take a look at the documentation, we discover that this class has two designated initalizers, initWithContext: and initWithEntity:insertIntoManagedObjectContext:.\nAs we have no idea about what an NSEntityDescription is, let's try to use the initWithContext: that requires simply a reference to a NSManagedObjectContext instance (aka. the graph instance).\nLet's try the following code:\nAnd test it inside a playground:\nCreating the node like this does not seems to be the right way. If we would have read the complete\ndocumentation of this method, this crash wouldn't be a surprise:\nThis method is only legal to call on subclasses of NSManagedObject that represent a single entity in the model.\n{: .notice }\nAs we have no idea about why would we have subclasses of nodes for now, we have no other choice than trying the other option.\nThe initWithEntity:insertIntoManagedObjectContext: method requires one instance of the NSEntityDescription class along with one instance of the NSManagedObjectContext class.\nWhat is the purpose of NSEntityDescription?\nModeling the nodes and the graph\nYou should ask yourself why CoreData would need another piece of information than the graph instance to create our node?\nGenerally, the graph you're creating using CoreData is an abstraction that matches a real concept of your own. In this concept, you may have differents type of nodes and some specific rules about how the nodes can be connected. Each node would also hold some data.\nCoreData is expecting this piece of information in the form of one instance of the NSEntityDescription class.\nCreating a graph without a basic set of rules would not make sense.\nLet's imagine a simple set of rules for the rest of this post. We want to create a graph representing the organization graph of a company. We have two types of node:\nBoss: A named person that (generally) rarely code and manages one or more people. This person has also at most one boss on top of her.\nEmployee: A named person that (generally) manages no one due to high productivity and has a speciality. This person can have multiple bosses.\nFrom those sentences we can create a basic set of rules:\nWe have two types of nodes: Boss and Employee.\nA Boss node has a name property.\nAn Employee node has one name property and one speciality property.\nA Boss node has a link to several Employee nodes. Let's call this link employees.\nA Boss node has a link to a specific Boss node (it's own boss). Let's call this link boss.\nA Boss node has a link to the bosses under him. Let's call this link underbosses.\nAn Employee node a link to all his own bosses. Let's call this link bosses.\nAll those rules can be splitted into two categories:\nAttribute: The data attached to the node. (name and property here)\nRelationship: The rules describing how the nodes can be linked. (boss, bosses, employees and underbosses)\nCoreData has exactly two classes that represent those concepts: NSAttributeDescription and NSRelationshipDescription (both inherit from NSPropertyDescription). In fact, NSEntityDescription is just a container around a set of NSPropertyDescription subclasses.\nTo create the rules, we would just need to create the appropriate instances of NSAttributeDescription and NSRelationshipDescription describing our business logic.\nLet's start with the different containers for our Employee and Boss nodes. Each container is identified by its name property:\nThen we continue with the different existing attributes:\nYou should notice that:\nEach attribute is identified by its name property.\nEach attribute has a type (attributeType). You can check the NSAttributeType enum for all the available types.\nYou can provide a default value if needed.\nNow we can describe the relationships:\nEach relationship object is identified by its name property. You configure the relationship with the following options:\ndestinationEntity: The name of the NSEntityDescription targeted by this relationship.\nminCount: The minimum value of nodes targeted by this relationship.\nmaxCount: The maximum value of nodes targeted by this relationship. Using 0 means no limit.\ndeleteRule: When the node hosting this relationship is deleted, this property tells to CoreData what to do with the targeted node(s) (delete them also, simply cut the edges, etc).\nNow we can assign each properties to the corresponding NSEntityDescription:\nIf you have paid attention to the relationship's rules, you would have notice that some relationships are kind of \"connected\". Getting the bosses property of the Employee node is the opposite of getting the employees property of the Boss node.\nBy opposite I mean that if you have one Employee node and you get one Boss node through the bosses property, you can go back to the Employee instance by using the employees property of the Boss node.\nThis should be expressed in CoreData by using the inverseRelationship property of NSRelationshipDescription:\nNow we can try to create a graph and one Boss node inside it:\nThe output gives us:\nGreat, we succeeded to create a graph instance and one node!\nReducing the boilerplate code with NSManagedObjectModel\nOur current graph rules are basic and you would have noticed that we required a lot of lines\nto describes them. Using code is not the only way to describe our business logic. Inside the documentation of the NSEntityDescription, you will find this sentence:\nYou usually define entities in a Managed object model using the data modeling tool in Xcode\n{: .notice }\nIf you have heard about CoreData before, the Managed Object Model is the first tool you have been presented\nto without any further information. It will help to create a bunch of NSEntityDescription with a graphical editor. This will produce one .xcdatamodel model file that will be compiled into one .momd file.\nIf this file is present in your application's bundle, you will be able to access it from CoreData API to create one NSManagedObjectModel instance.\nA NSManagedObjectModel instance is basically a bag that contains all the NSEntityDescription, NSAttributeDescription and NSRelationshipDescription we defined in the editor.\nAssuming you have recreated the previous rules using a .xcdatamodel, you can load them using the NSManagedObjectModel class:\nThen we can retrieve the NSEntityDescription we are interested in and reuse the same code to instantiate the node and the graph:\nAnd the output is exactly the same as before.\nWorking on the node\nCreating empty nodes is not really usefull. We should be able to modify the data they contain and create connections between them. For now we have a graph of basic NSManagedObject instances.\nHow do we access to the node's properties we have defined? By taking a look to the NSManagedObject documentation, a paragraph gives us some information:\nCore Data automatically generates accessor methods (and primitive accessor methods) for you. For attributes and to-one relationships, Core Data generates the standard get and set accessor methods; for to-many relationships, Core Data generates the indexed accessor methods as described in Achieving Basic Key-Value Coding Compliance in Key-Value Coding Programming Guide. You do however need to declare the accessor methods or use Objective-C properties to suppress compiler warnings. For a full discussion, see Managed Object Accessor Methods in Core Data Programming Guide.\n{: .notice }\nWhat does this means is that CoreData makes your node automatically KVC/KVO compliant according to the relationships and attributes you defined in the model.\nIn addition to this, you have two methods defined in NSManagedObjectContext that provide you a read and write access to the NSManagedObjectModel private storage that do not trigger KVO notifications.\nOnce we know this, we can play a little further. Let's reload the graph and load\nboth entities:\nWe create a Boss node and try to read the default name value:\nWe can change the name:\nNow it is time to connect some nodes:\nWe can check that the connection is effective:\nAdding business semantics and rereduce boilerplate\nYou should tell me that this looks like boilerplate code again. Using the KVC primitives is error prone and not really developer friendly. The documentation of NSManagedObject has a suggestion:\nYou may create custom subclasses of NSManagedObject, although this is not always required. If no custom logic is needed, a complete Object graph can be formed with NSManagedObject instances.\n{: .notice}\nCreating NSManagedObject subclasses will benefit from the whole power of KVC. For the Boss node, we can create a subclass:\n@NSManaged is a swift statement that corresponds to the Objective-C @dynamic statement. The Objective-C equivalent of the previous code is:\nIf you remember, using @dynamic promises that, if an objective-c property (getter/setter) does not exist at compile-time, an implementation will be provided at runtime (Here, they are provided by CoreData).\nSo we can refactor the previous code using subclasses. Let first declare the Boss and Employee classes:\nNote: Regarding in which module namespace you are working, you may need to override manually the name of the class in Objective-C.\nHere we are working in the global namespace of a playground (no prefix). We have to specify it manually using one @objc statement.\nModifying the contents of the nodes is now a piece of cake:\nIs this black magic?\nThe generation of KVC properties and the usage of @dynamic/@NSManaged looks like black magic but it is not.\nCoreData is one Objective-C framework and rely highly on the dynamicity of the language. Let's try to have a basic idea on how is CoreData working under the hood.\nIf you have ever played with the Objective-C runtime, you would know that you can perform a lot at\nruntime, like adding an instance variable to existing compiled classes 4.\nLet's create a basic NSObject subclass and declares a variables as @NSManaged/@dynamic:\nFor now we can not call the value property because it does not exist:\nThe idea is to add an instance variable to the class and both getter and setter to the class at runtime.\nWe will use the objc_getAssociatedObject, objc_setAssociatedObject and class_addMethod of the Objective-C runtime.\nLet's start with the instance variable:\nTo implement a method, you have to remember that each Objc method's implementation is provided by one IMP.\nThis corresponds to a C pointer of function. We know that this pointer of function has the same arguments as its corresponding selector in addition to the class instance and the instance of the selector as first arguements.\nWe can create an implementation of those functions:\nNow we can simply add those methods to the runtime:\nWe can now test our basic runtime changes:\nIt does not crash anymore and the behaviour is the one expected. Of course CoreData is using a much more sophisticated strategy to compute and provide all the required properties at runtime. This is done during the object's initialization. The documentation of initWithEntity:insertIntoManagedObjectContext: specifies:\nNSManagedObject uses dynamic class generation to support the Objective-C 2 properties feature (see Declared Properties) by automatically creating a subclass of the class appropriate for entity. initWithEntity:insertIntoManagedObjectContext: therefore returns an instance of the appropriate class for entity. The dynamically-generated subclass will be based on the class specified by the entity, so specifying a custom class in your model will supersede the class passed to alloc.\n{: .notice }\nWe know the basic about how to model and create our graph and our nodes. In a next post, we'll take a look about the other face of CoreData and see how we can persist our graph on the disk.\n1\nMastering Core Data - WWDC 2010 - Session 128\n2\nCore Data: Data Storage and Management for iOS, OS X, and iCloud 2nd Edition - Marcus Zarra\n3\nCore Data - Florian Kugler and Daniel Eggert\n4\nAssociated Objects - NSHipster.com","id":"https://blog.yageek.net/a-taste-of-core-data-0-a-graph-framework/","title":"A taste of CoreData - Part 0 - A graph framework"},"https://blog.yageek.net/addsubview-tag-et-gestion-duiview-custom/":{"body":"Lors d'une petite session de programmation iOS, j'ai voulu créer une vue personnalisée composée de différentes subviews.

This wonderfull API\n(thanks @mattt), we can use three different\ncertificate pinning strategies with no effort.\nDuring the development phase, the pinning was working really good out of the box and we\nwere very confident for the production :)\nSadly, after releasing the app into production, we noticed a strange issue with the pinning process.\nThe delegate method connection:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge: from the AFURLConnectionOperation\nwas not called everytime, even if the credential storage was not used...\nMy colleague fell on this issue on Github that refers to an\nApple Technical Q&amp;A. We discover the existence of a\nlow level cache regarding the TLS connection.\nAfter reading that carefully, the problem was obvious.\nWe use AFNetworking to connect to our API. We also use an analytics tool that does not use AFNetworking and does not implement any certificate\npinning strategy.\nDuring the development phase, we use a stubbed server that fakes the data of the client. In this environment, both URLS have a different hostname.\nBut in production, both URLs have the same hostname, only the paths differ.\nWhen the analytics tool speaks to the endpoint api.endpoint.com/analytics, if the certificate is valid, it accepts the certificate but does not \"pin\" it.\nThis answer will be cached for 10 minutes for any request reaching the api.endpoint.com hostname.\nThen when AFNetworking will speak to api.endpoint.com/api, CFNetwork will use the previous cached response and will not call the\nconnection:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge and the certificate will not be pinned :(\nTo fix it, as preconised in the technical Q&amp;A, we changed the analytics endpoint to prevent the use of the cache.\nMorality: AFNetworking rocks. But are you only using the network through this library ? If not, check that some other component\nwill not compromise your certificate pinning strategy.","id":"https://blog.yageek.net/afnetworking-certificate-pinning-issues/","title":"Certificate Pinning issues with AFNetworking"},"https://blog.yageek.net/appel-depuis-letranger-avec-le-forfait/":{"body":"Je suis rentré ce week end à la maison juste avant que mes parents partent en vacances en Croatie.

While the calabash tests were executed, a new issue appears.\nWe have several backends to speak with. Each uses a SSL certificate, not necessarily a certificate signed by a root CA trusted by iOS.\nAs explained on the web, it is not a big deal to add a certificate as a trusted one on the simulators: simply drag and drop the concerned certificate on the simulator window.\nOur calabash test sequences need to work with fresh new simulators and automatically reset them before starting. By resetting them, we loose all the previous work we did to add the trusted certificates.\nI started looking if there was another way to automate the process.\nBy having used Charles Proxy in the past, I remembered that using the SSL proxying option required that you install a certificate generated by Charles as a trusted one on the simulator.\nI also remembered that Charles was able to handle it alone.\nAfter looking within the Mac Ox X bundle of the app, I noticed a bash script with an interesting name: install-charles-ca-cert-for-iphone-simulator.sh.\nBy reading it, I understood that the trusted certificates are stored in a sqlite3 database somewhere in the simulator's directories.\nBy Googling a little bit, I discover the ADVTrustStore github repository.\nIt contains a script helping you to install certificates from the command line and a wonderful description on how are\ntrusted certificates handled within the simulators.\nI wanted to use the python script, but it does not import a certificate directly on\nall the simulators, it asks for each simulator it founds if you want to install it :(\nBased on this work and the documentation provided, I wrote a gem that automates all the process.\nTo install it:\nIf you want to install a certificate as a trusted one, symply run:\nNow you have no excuse to avoid certificate pinning :)","id":"https://blog.yageek.net/certificate-pinning-ios-simulators/","title":"Certificate pinning on iOS simulators with iostrust"},"https://blog.yageek.net/chenillard/":{"body":"Matrix LED 8x16 Vidéo envoyée par arcturusm51 Le chenillard sur le projet est fonctionnel.

Sur le coup, je n’ai pas vraiment saisi en quoi consistait le jeu, mais je me suis dit pourquoi pas....Le géocaching késako : il s’agit d’un jeu auquel on peut jouer un peu partout dans le monde (même en Antarctique), en ville, en fôret, pendant qu’on fait de l’escalade, du vélo, de la plongée … Muni d’un GPS où d’une simple carte de la zone de jeu, il faut trouver une boite, petite, grande, minuscule, visuelle...Selon les indices que vous avez accumulés, la difficulté et le terrain, le temps nécessaire à la découverte peut s’allonger considérablement. Il n’y a rien à gagner, seulement, le plaisir de chercher et de parapher le “logbook” présent dans chacune.Le nombre de caches dépasse les 1.700.000 et évolue constamment. Il y en a potentiellement une près de la où vous vous trouvez. Le pays avec le plus grand nombre de caches sont les USA (comme le jeu) et en Europe, des pays comme l’Allemagne regorgent de caches au kilomètre carré.Le plus gros site est géré par la société Groundspeak et se trouve à cette adresse : http://www.geocaching.com. L’inscription est gratuite et suffisante pour jouer. L’option Premium vous offre des avantages pour les plus assidus, comme des statistiques, télécharger des caches en grand nombres ….Pour commencer, il vous faut :S’inscrire sur le site et se trouver un pseudo hype et coolTrouver la cache la plus proche de chez vous pour commencer.Bien regarder quel types de caches l’on recherche (simple, mystère, multi, …) et vérifier si l’on est apte et équiper pour la réaliser.Un GPS idéalement, mais on peut s’en passer.(J’ai croisé des gens qui ont fait leur 2000 première sans)Un crayon pour s’enregistrerUne paire de basket et des vieux habits selon le terrainLe smartphone a démocratisé le GPS et c’est le moyen le plus rapide et efficace de faire du géocaching. Évitez l’application Groundspeak officielle sur l’Android market. Pour la version iPhone, essayez des applis gratuites avant d’acheter l’officielle ( paraitrait qu’elle est pas mal, mais je n’ai jamais testé. Faites un tour par ici : http://www.iphoneness.com/iphone-apps/geocaching-apps-for-ios/)Pour Android, sans hésiter : c:geo pour les caches + Locus free pour utiliser des cartes sans 3G.Pour faire découvrir cette activité geek IRL, j’aimerais bien organiser une journée Géocaching un week end, histoire de sortir un peu et de lâcher le PC et de découvrir la région. Je propose de faire cela pendant un week end, date variable selon les participants et la météo ! Je peux prêter deux appareils GPS pour ceux qui en sont dépourvus. J’imagine un circuit qui partirait du centre de Caen, une zone avec quelques caches très accessibles pour débuter et ensuite remonter vers la côte direction Ouistreham histoire de faire des caches le long de la plage et revenir sur Caen pour faire une cache qui semble valoir le coup (d'après mides.fr) dans une ancienne carrière au Sud de Caen.Chaque cache possède un numéro, appellé gcode, du type GCXXXX grâce auquel on peut identifier la cache sur geocaching.com ou en tapant http://coord.info/GCXXXX directement dans le navigateur.Pour s’y mettre dès à present, je vous invite à réfléchir dès maintenant sur des caches mystères du Centre Ville, histoire de simplement aller cueillir votre cache une fois arrivé en Ville : GC1T5NP, GC20GKD, GC1T5TN, GC3H1W3, GC3M1KMUn petit Doodle pour l'évènement :&nbsp;http://www.doodle.com/y9mdeimuns3z8bm7","id":"https://blog.yageek.net/journee-geocaching/","title":"Journée Géocaching"},"https://blog.yageek.net/las-vegas/":{"body":"La ville au lumière est tout simplement incroyable.

Cette question m'a trotté dans l'esprit un bon moment !\nJ'ai alors regardé sur le grand Internet pour avoir des pistes de reflexion. J'ai trouvé la liste du matériel pour fair e une insoleuse à deux néons :\nDeux tubes néons.\nUn ballast.\nDeux starters. Deux supports pour starters.\nQuatres supports pour néons. (2 par extrémité)\nAprès quelques recherches, mon matériel exact est :\nDeux néons 8 watts.\nUn ballast 18 watts.\nDeux starters 4-22 watts series ST-151 de chez OSRAM.\nQuatre supports pour néons.\nDeux supports pour ballast.\nVous pourrez trouver ce matériel chez tous les grands fournisseurs en ligne. Pour ma part je suis aller chez Conrad. Seul hic, il n'avait plus de ballast, j'ai du me fournir chez un fournisseur près de chez moi pour trois fois le prix internet (SIEHR pour ceux qui ne recevront pas de ballast non plus :-( ). Pour les starters, j'en ai racheté dans le magasin de luminaire du coin,n'ayant pas remarqué que ceux que j'avais commandé aurait été bons (je ne l'ai remarque que plus tard. Mais ouf, un starter c'est moins de 1 € ).\nExplications :\nLe choix des composants est lié au choix des tubes. Vous devez déterminer combien de tubes vous souhaitez prendre. Cela dépends de la taille des circuits que vous souhaitez réaliser. J'ai choisi deux petits néons parce que je ne savais pas trop quoi prendre et que j'avais déja entendu via des forums que des personnes avaient opté pour cette solution et que cela marchait. Dans mon cas, nous avons une puissance de 16 watts (2 fois 8 watts).\nLe ballast est choisi en fonction des tubes. Je dois fournir 16 watts à mes tubes. J'ai pris un ballast 18 watts de chez ets spanien (ref: `a mettre). La puissance indiquée sur le ballast est la puissance qu'il fournit sous une certaine tension(généralement celle du secteur, cette tension est toujours notée sur le ballast).

Je vous donne ici la fin de l'histoire.Après l'envoi d'une lettre avec accusé de réception au service-consommateurs de l'opérateur, un email à la DGGCRF, un courrier à la DDPP du Bas-Rhin, celle du Calvados (ne jamais faire les choses à moitié) et un post sur le forum &nbsp;du site lesarnaques.com, je reçois un appel 4 jours plus tard de la part du service-consommateurs. La personne au bout du fil me confirme qu'aucun papier n' a été signé et annule de suite l'offre promotionnelle. Ceci me permet de bénéficier immédiatement, si je le souhaite, de la loi Chatel et je n'ai rien à rembourser.Un retournement de situation aussi rapide montre que SFR savait depuis le départ que ce réengagement était abusif. Une fois la réclamation faite, ils n'avaient d'autre choix que de l'annuler.Je pense que ces méthodes traduisent une difficulté de la part de SFR pour garder des clients et plutôt que de leur offrir des prestations aux meilleurs prix, il utilises ses CGV pour piéger le client et s'assurer de toucher le maximum. Je trouve ça dommage de la part d'une grande enseigne qui dénonce les méthodes du nouvel arrivant ...Quoi qu'il en soit, dans n'importe quel litige de cette sorte, n'oubliez pas de faire un tour sur internet pour voir si votre problème n'a pas été soulevé et signaler votre cas à la DGCCRF via internet et à la DDPP de votre département.

Free accusé de pratiques douteuses aux grand dam des trois piliers du secteurs, on en rigolerait presque. Du moins, pas autant que moi aujourd'hui.Après 2 ans de fidélité à la Société Française du Radiotéléphone, je souhaite passer du côté obscur de la force et bénéficier d'un forfait téléphone moins cher avec lequel je peux faire du tethering pour 0 € de plus, chose possible uniquement chez un seul opérateur&nbsp;actuellement.J'appelle le service client pour confirmer la simulation de résiliation faite peu de temps avant. J'avais souscrit à un abonnement en septembre 2010 pour 24 mois et avait changé pour un autre forfait en mai 2011. La date de fin de contrat tombait le 31 mai 2013. J'étais pile-poil dans la seconde année pour profiter de la loi Chatel :)&nbsp;Malheureusement, on m'annonce que le 30 avril 2012, je me suis réengagé pour 12 mois et que la loi Chatel ne s'appliquait pas. Frais de résiliations : plus de 400 € !Effectivement, fin avril, une opératrice SFR m'a passé un coup de fil pour me proposer une réduction de 5€ sur mon forfait mensuel. Méfiant, je lui avait demandé de confirmer que cette offre était bien gratuite et qu'elle ne me&nbsp;réengageait&nbsp;en rien, ce que la dame fit. J'avais accepté trop naïvement.En regardant sur divers forum, je découvre que je ne suis pas le seul à qui cette mésaventure est arrivée. Pire encore, ces pratiques sont dénoncées même jusqu'au sein du gouvernement.D'après l'article L121-127 du Code de la Consommation&nbsp;qui conditionne le démarchage téléphonique, tout engagement doit être signé par le consommateur. Hors, je n'ai jamais rien signé, le réengagement est abusif. Je rappelle le service client pour lui faire part de mes recherches mais la personne ne peut rien faire hormis me proposer un geste commercial, ce que je refuse. Ces arrangements ont uniquement pour but de rendre vos frais de résiliations tellement énormes, que vous préférerez renégociez votre contrat et vous forcez à vous réengager encore plus longtemps.&nbsp;Je suis assez surpris de voir qu'une grande enseigne comme SFR (apparemment pas la seule) utilise ce genre de méthodes et que&nbsp;malgré&nbsp;les dénonciations de l'ARCEP, du gouvernement et la DGCCRF, le manquement de sanctions pénales permet à ces gros bonnets de&nbsp;s’asseoir une fois de plus sur le consommateur.&nbsp;J'ai contacté la DGCCRF en espérant pouvoir quitter SFR avant la fin de l'année.

Just grab a UIWebView and call loadHTMLString:baseURL or loadData:MIMEType:textEncodingName:baseURL: and enjoy the results.\nThis component would fit your needs 90% of the time. But in some cases, having a simple UIWebView is not enough.\nFor professional reasons, I had to implement a mail reader like screen. On such a screen, there is a fixed portion on the screen that scrolls along with the portion rendering the HTML. I did not build such a view before and start thinking how I could make it.\nAfter thinking a little bit, I first thought about implementing the fixed portion in HTML/CSS. No offense to those technologies, but they are not really my cup of tea.\nI start searching on the Internet to see if someone founds a nice way implementing this without using private APIS.\nTweaking the internal UIWebBrowserView\nEach UIWebView contains a UIScrolView. Inside this scroll view, the HTML is rendered by a Apple internal private UIView subclass named UIWebBrowserView. It is possible to get a reference to this subview.\nTo have a reference to it, simply loop over the subviews contained within the UIScrollView of the UIWebView:\nOnce you grab it, you can use and place this view by setting its frame.\nThis works great, but it has the smell of a big workaround :( Would it be possible to do it in a easier way ?\nDo it thanks to the documentation\nI read the article in the great objc.io concerning scroll views and the start of a solution appears by reading the part Tweaking the Window with Content Insets.\nThe main idea is to use the contentInset property of the UIScrollView of the UIWebView to create a space at the top of the UIWebView and fill it with some view.\nIt is better to see with an example. Let's create a UIWebView subclass named AwesomeWebView. This will be a web view with a 100 points red view at this top.\nAll the work could be done in the initializer. The only thing to consider, is that adding a contentInset create a zone in the view where the coordinates are negatives.\nThis methods seems to be better than the first one.\nYou can find an example of this method on github","id":"https://blog.yageek.net/scrollable-custom-view-inside-a-uiwebview/","title":"Scrollable custom view inside a UIWebView"},"https://blog.yageek.net/simcert-certificate-installation/":{"body":"Few months ago, I wrote a Ruby gem named iostrust to automate the installation of trusted certificate on the different iOS simulators.\nThis is really helpful when you have a development process that includes continuous integration.\nIn our case, we perform some tests with calabash each time someone commits to git and before starting the tests, we reset the simulator.

Mieux, je capte mieux le réseau Free que je ne le captais chez SFR. On pourrait penser que cela soit du à mon changement de téléphone.C'est possible ! En tout cas, nous étions la semaine dernière soir à Luc-Sur-Mer et mes amis qui avait SFR ne captait rien du tout sur la plage.
